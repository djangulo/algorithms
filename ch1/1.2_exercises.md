## Exercises

#### 1.2-1 Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

A simple CRUD application with a search function would need an efficient algorithm to search and pinpoint an entry.

#### 1.2-2 Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in $8n^2$ steps, while merge sort runs in $64n \lg n$ steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?

For any $n$ where the inequation $8n^2<64n\lg n$ holds true.

#### 1.2-3 What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n2 runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2n on the same machine?

$100n^2 < 2n$

$2n(50n - 1)<0$

$n < \frac{1}{50}$

Testing for $n=\frac{1}{51}$, we get $\qquad 100(\frac{1}{51})^2<\frac{2}{51}$ we get $0.03845<0.03921$, which is of course true.

## Problems

#### 1-1 Comparison of running times
For each function $f(n)$ and time $t$ in the following table, determine the largest
size n of a problem that can be solved in time t , assuming that the algorithm to
solve the problem takes f .n/ microseconds.
