#### 2.1-1 Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the array $A=\langle 31,41,59,26,41,58\rangle$.

#### 2.1-2 Rewrite the $\textsf{INSERTION-SORT}$ procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing order.

In order to make $\textsf{INSERTION-SORT}$ sort in decreasing order is flip the $\gt$ in line 5 for a $lt$.

(This is shown in the `InsertionSortDesc.go` file, and the tests are in `InsertionSort_test.go`)

#### 2.1-3
Consider the **searching problem**:

**Input:** A sequence of $n$ numbers $A=\langle a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\rangle$ and a value $v$.
**Output:** An index $i$ such that $v=A[i]$ or the special value $\textsf{NIL}$ if $v$ does not appear in $A$.

Write pseudocode for **linear search**, which scans through the sequence, looking
for $v$. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that
your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

    for j = 1 to A.length:
            if A[j] = v
                return j
        return NIL

**Loop invariant** At the start of each iteration of the for loop the subarray $A [1 .. j - 1]$ **does not** contain the value $v$ that we're looking for.

**initialization:** before initializing the loop $A[1 .. j - 1] = A[1 .. (0) - 1] A is empty, therefore v cannot exist in A, the loop invariant remains true.

**Maintenance**:
The Loop invariant holds, the loop searches A[j], after A[j-1], A[j-2], ..., A[1] failed to produce the value $v$

**Termination:** The condition causing the for loop to terminate, is $j > A.length = n$. Each loop increases $j$ by $1$, therefore in the last loop $j = n + 1$. Substituting j in the initial loop invariant wording, the subarray $A[1 .. n] = A$ **does not** contain the value $v$

#### 2.1-4 Consider the problem of adding two $n$-bit binary integers, stored in two $n$-element arrays $A$ and $B$. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an $(n+1)$-element array $C$. State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers.

Input: Arrays $A=\langle a_1,a_2,...,a_n\rangle$ and $B=\langle b_1,b_2,...,b_n\rangle$, where $A.length=B.length=n$ and each element $a_i\in\{0,1\}$ and $b_i\in\{0,1\}$

Output: An array $C=\langle c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n+1}\rangle$, where each element $c_i\in\{0,1\}$

    C = Array[1..A.length + 1]
    carry = 0
    for j = A.length downto 1
        temp = A[j] + B[j] + carry
        C[j+1] = temp % 2
        carry = temp / 2
    C[1] = carry
